# Snake Water Gun Combat

Snake Water Gun Combat is a simple web-based game where you compete against the computer by choosing one of three elements: Snake, Water, or Gun. Each round, both you and the computer make a choice, and the winner of the round is determined based on the rules:

- Snake drinks Water (Snake wins)
- Water extinguishes Gun (Water wins)
- Gun shoots Snake (Gun wins)

The game continues until either you or the computer reaches a score of 5.
